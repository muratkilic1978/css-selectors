# CSS Selectors
A **CSS selector** selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

## CSS Selectors can be divided into 5 categories:

- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
- Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
- Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
- Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
- Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
